# [CIRC](http://noahsug.github.com/circ)
**An IRC client in the shape of a packaged Chrome app**

CIRC uses the chrome.socket API to connect directly to IRC servers without needing a proxy. It has a ton of other killer features as well such as syncing your IRC state accross all your devices and allowing you to use a single IRC connection on multiple devices simultaneously.

Get it on the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/circ/kgiicflppioaphimaahahimadngieohn/internal
